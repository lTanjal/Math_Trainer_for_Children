## Structured Learning Approach
Mathematical problems are divided into 23 topics. For each topic, you solve 10 examples. Once completed, the program checks your answers. If all answers are correct, a fun animation appears as a reward. If there are mistakes, the program highlights the errors and displays the correct answers.
